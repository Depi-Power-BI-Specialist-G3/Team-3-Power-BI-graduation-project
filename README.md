MTA DAILY RIDERSHIP 

🚀 Introduction

This project explores the MTA Daily Ridership dataset, which captures how millions of New Yorkers move across subways, buses, commuter rails, ferries, and bridges every day
By applying data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, measure shifts in travel behavior, and provide insights into how ridership has evolved—especially in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.
Our goal is to turn raw transportation data into clear, actionable insights that highlight the scale and dynamics of North America’s largest transit network.
